I am **Shengkun Ma** (马胜坤), now an intern in *[Knowledge Engineering Group (KGE)](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/)*, *[Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/)*, supervised by Prof. Juanzi Li. Before that, I graduated from the School of Computer Science at *[Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/)* with my master'degree, supervised by Prof. Bo Cheng.
Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology at *[Xidian University (XDU)](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/)*.

I am doing some research work about Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC). My general research interests include **Information Extraction**, **Natural Language Understanding** and **Evaluation of Large Language Models**.
