Hello, I'm **Shengkun Ma** (马胜坤), a final-year graduate student in *[Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/)*, China, supervised by Prof. Bo Cheng.
Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology at *[Xidian University (XDU)](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/)*.

My research interests include **relation extraction**, **continual learning** and **large language models (LLMs)**.
Now, I'm focus on **open-domain retrieval** and **reasoning** with LLMs.
This is my [CV](https://mashengkun.github.io/files/ShengkunMa_CV.pdf).

**I am actively seeking PhD/RA opportunities for 2024/2025 ^_^**
